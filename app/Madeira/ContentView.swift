// 2026-07-03 window-hosted Metal layer.
//
// The presenting CAMetalLayer must NOT be a SwiftUI-hosted view's backing
// layer: on iOS 26/27, SwiftUI's hosting intermittently routes such layers
// through an indirect/snapshot path where direct Metal presentations are
// silently dropped — presented drawables complete with presentedTime==0
// (measured), the screen freezes on stale content, and only full-tree
// re-renders (screenshots) reveal new frames. Which path a given run gets
// appeared random — the "sometimes rendering starts at present #9,
// sometimes never" lottery.
//
// So the layer now lives in MetalHostView, a raw UIView added directly to
// the UIWindow (classic game setup, no SwiftUI management). The SwiftUI-
// hosted MetalBackedView remains as a transparent layout placeholder that
// tracks geometry and handles touch input. The host view sits on top of
// the window but has interaction disabled, so touches fall through to the
// SwiftUI hierarchy (and thus to the placeholder's touch handlers).

/// How the guest surface (the fixed-resolution virtual display games render
/// into — see `MetalBackedView.guestSize()`) is mapped into the live view's
/// bounds. A tap on `displayModeToggle` (ContentView) cycles Fit -> Fill ->
/// Stretch -> Fit and the choice persists via InputSettings.

    // Three recognisers, because iOS splits one mouse across three shapes:
    //   • hover  — movement with no button down. Absolute positions; we keep
    //              the previous one and send the difference.
    //   • drag   — movement WITH a button down. Hover stops during a drag, so
    //              a pan restricted to `.indirectPointer` carries it instead.
    //   • scroll — the wheel, delivered as a pan with no touches at all when
    //              `allowedScrollTypesMask` is set.
    // Buttons themselves are indirect-pointer TOUCHES, intercepted at the top
    // of touchesBegan/Ended/Cancelled and read off `UIEvent.buttonMask`.
    //
    // None of this may touch a finger. `allowedTouchTypes` on both pans is
    // restricted to `.indirectPointer` (the scroll pan accepts no touch type at
    // all), the hover recogniser is not a touch recogniser to begin with, and

    // simultaneously — so `ControlOverlayView`'s multi-touch arbitration and
    // the trackpad/game touch paths below are unchanged.

/// ml661 — EVERY HELD CONTROL DECLARES WHAT IT WANTS HELD; NOTHING POSTS EDGES.
///
/// The sticks and buttons used to be edge-triggered in their own `@State`:
/// "the thumb crossed into a new sector, so post W-up and A-down". That is
/// only correct while the view survives to post the closing edge, and a
/// SwiftUI view under a thumb has several ways not to:
///
///   • `DragGesture` has no cancellation callback. A system edge-swipe, the
///     control-centre pull, or another recogniser winning simply means
///     `onEnded` is never called — the key stays down forever.
///   • Toggling the landscape controls off (`TouchControlsModel.visible`), or
///     entering edit mode, or rotating, removes the whole `ForEach` body. The
///     view is gone; `onEnded` will never arrive.
///   • Two controls can bind the same key. Edge-triggered, whichever lifts
///     first releases it out from under the other.
///
/// So ownership replaces edges. A control says "owner 7 wants {W, A}" and this
/// class posts the difference between the union of all owners' wishes and what
/// it has actually sent down. Releasing an owner is a single call that cannot
/// be got wrong, an owner that vanishes takes its keys with it, and a shared
/// key stays down while any owner still wants it.
///
/// On top of that sits a 1Hz reconciler. It compares this app-side intent
/// against `winios_held_keys()` — what the DRIVER was actually told — and
/// repairs a disagreement that survives three ticks: a key wine thinks is down
/// that nobody wants gets an up, a key an owner wants that never reached wine
/// gets its down re-sent. That makes a lost transition self-healing rather

// ============================================================================
// ml662 — ONE UIKIT MULTI-TOUCH LAYER FOR EVERY ON-SCREEN CONTROL.
//
// ml661 made a control that STOPS being held release correctly. It could not
// make a control be held in the first place, because that was never in our
// hands: every control was a SwiftUI `DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0)` and
// SwiftUI gestures are arbitrated by UIGestureRecognizers, which are built for
// ONE gesture at a time on a scrolling document — not for four thumbs on a
// gamepad. Concretely, and all three were reported from the same build:
//
//   • A button only fires once its recogniser reaches .began. A simultaneous
//     recogniser elsewhere (the live view's, the other window's, a system edge
//     gesture) can delay that transition past the lift, or fail it outright.
//     The tap is simply never delivered — "the buttons still aren't 100%
//     being registered".
//   • A second touch ANYWHERE makes UIKit re-run arbitration, and the losing
//     recogniser is cancelled. `@GestureState` resets, ml661's cancel path
//     correctly releases the stick — and the aim stick dies mid-aim because a
//     stray finger brushed the live view. Correct behaviour, wrong cause.
//   • `onEnded` can arrive late or, after a cancellation, never.
//
// None of that is fixable inside the gesture model, so the gesture model is
// gone from the play path. Raw UIKit multi-touch has exactly the semantics a
// gamepad needs and has had them since 2008: `touchesBegan/Moved/Ended/
// Cancelled` deliver every finger independently, each `UITouch` keeps its
// identity from began to ended, and a touch delivered to one view is unaffected
// by touches delivered to another.
//
// So: ONE `ControlOverlayView`, a plain multi-touch UIView sitting at the very
// top of the window stack, owns every control's touch. Controls are REGIONS in
// window coordinates, registered by the SwiftUI views that draw them (the
// `.controlRegion` modifier below), so layout stays declarative and only input
// moves. The rules are the ones the failures name:
//
//   1. The region under a touch's INITIAL location owns that touch until it
//      ends or is cancelled. No other touch can take it, release it, or
//      cancel it.
//   2. A stick follows its own touch's `location(in:)` even far outside its
//      frame; a button releases if its own finger slides off (and re-presses
//      if it slides back).
//   3. `hitTest` returns nil everywhere except on a region, so the live view
//      keeps every touch that is not on a control — and because those touches
//      land in a DIFFERENT view (and a different window), they cannot cancel a
//      control's touch.
//   4. `InputGuard` still owns everything actually posted, keyed per TOUCH
//      rather than per view — so a duplicate release is a no-op and a touch
//      that vanishes takes its keys with it.

// a value-type snapshot is the whole of the thread story, and it is the same
// story `PadSnapshot` already tells for the physical pad: built on one thread,

// CONTRIBUTIONS ARE KEYED BY REGION, not accumulated as edges. The same rule

// reason: a lost "up" from a cancelled touch would otherwise pin a button down
// for the session, and that is the single most reported symptom in this file's
// history. A region that stops contributing removes its entry; the aggregate is
// recomputed from what is left, so nothing can leak.
//
// PRESENCE IS NOT PRESSURE. `present` counts REGISTERED pad controls, not held
// ones: XInput's contract is that a connected controller answers with zeroes,
// and a slot that only appears on the first press would read to a game as a
// controller being hot-plugged mid-frame.

    // re-framed under a live finger, an event delivered while the app is being
    // suspended, a `UITouch` reclaimed for a new sequence — each drops the
    // closing callback, and a per-touch table keyed by address then holds a
    // PHANTOM: an entry for a finger that is not on the glass.

    // A phantom is not a cosmetic leak. Its `InputGuard` owner is still in the

    // `AimStickDriver.vecs`, so the camera drifts and the stick reads dead.

    // reconciles it against the only authority there is, the live `UITouch`
    // objects UIKit hands us. Anything tracked that is not among them — or that
    // UIKit has already deallocated, or that it now reports as ended/cancelled

    // THE RULE THIS OBEYS. A pad button is a SECOND FINGER, not a second input
    // system. It takes an `InputGuard` owner exactly as a touch does, it holds
    // exactly the `ControlRegionKind` that touch would have held, and it
    // publishes into the same `ControlFaces` state — so the reconciler in
    // `InputGuard.tick`, the coalescing ring behind `winios_post_key` and every
    // diagnostic that counts owners see one more finger and nothing they have
    // to be taught about.
    //
    // THE OWNER KIND IS THE BUTTON: one owner per physical button, for the life
    // of the session. Per-button rather than per-control is what makes
    // rebinding safe — moving a binding from one control to another restates
    // that one owner's key set and disturbs nothing else — and it is what lets
    // `padReleaseAll` be a complete, idempotent valve.
    //
    // A pad hold deliberately does NOT go in `tracked`: that table is keyed by
    // `UITouch` identity and every sweep in it asks UIKit whether the touch is
    // still alive. A button has no UITouch to ask about, and its release comes
    // from the sampler (or from `padReleaseAll`), which cannot be lost the way
    // a cancelled gesture can.

//
// 🔑 Everything here MUST live in its own UIWindow. MetalHostView is a raw
// window-level UIView above the whole SwiftUI hierarchy, so a control drawn in
// the normal content tree gets sliced off wherever it overlaps the game surface
// — and zIndex cannot fix that, because zIndex only orders siblings *within*
// SwiftUI. Same reason JoystickPadHost exists; see its comment.

///
/// Deliberately NOT `ControlAction.pad(String)`. That case says "this
/// on-screen button DRAWS an Xbox glyph", which was never wired to anything.
/// This says "this on-screen control is ALSO pressed by that physical button",
/// which is a second, orthogonal property of the same control: the control
/// keeps posting its own keys or mouse buttons, and the pad is a second finger
/// on it rather than a different action.

    // an Xbox glyph and, as the banner admitted, pressed nothing. What it
    // offers now is the physical button that ALSO presses this control, on top
    // of whatever the keyboard tab set it to. The distinction is the whole
    // feature: a control still posts its own key, and the pad is a second
    // finger on it, so one layout serves a thumb and a controller at once.
    //
    // A game that reads XInput sees the pad regardless of anything chosen
    // here — that path does not go through the layout at all (wine's
    // xinput1_3 reads the same sample through win32u). These bindings are for
    // the majority of titles, which read the keyboard and the mouse and have
    // never heard of a controller.

    // different things a controller can mean for one control and conflating
    // them is what shipped a screen full of buttons labelled "L".
    //
    //   MAKE IT a controller button  → sets `action`. The control IS an XInput
    //     button: it draws like one and a game polling XInput sees it pressed.
    //   ALSO PRESSED BY              → sets `padBinding`. The control keeps
    //     doing whatever the keyboard tab says, and a PHYSICAL button is a
