// ============================================================================
// ml663 — A REAL KEYBOARD AND A REAL MOUSE, BEHAVING LIKE ONE.
//
// Everything the app posted into wine until now originated as a FINGER: a touch
// on the live view, a region in ControlOverlayView, a thumb on a stick. Each of
// those had to invent the thing it was standing in for — a stick invents held
// arrow keys, the aim stick invents a stream of relative mouse counts, a tap
// invents a click. Plug a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse into the phone and there
// is nothing left to invent: the hardware already produces exactly the events
// Windows expects, and this file's whole job is to not lose them on the way.
//
// WHY GCKeyboard AND NOT UIKey / pressesBegan.
//
// UIKit's press pipeline is a TEXT pipeline wearing a keyboard costume. It is
// wrong for a game in three ways that cannot be configured away:
//
//   • Modifiers are not keys there. Holding Shift delivers no press at all; it
//     arrives as `modifierFlags` on the NEXT key's event. A game that walks on
//     W and sprints on Shift needs Shift's own down and up, on time.
//   • Auto-repeat is synthesised. Hold W and UIKit re-delivers it ~30×/s, each
//     one a down with no matching up. Wine would see W pressed thirty times a
//     second and the game would stutter-step.
//   • UIKeyCommand is a menu mechanism: it matches whole chords, consumes them,
//     and tells you nothing about release.
//
// GCKeyboard is the raw HID path — one callback per physical transition, with
// the modifiers as ordinary keys and no repeat. That is a keyboard.
//
// WHAT THE VK MAP IS KEYED ON.
//
// `GCKeyCode.rawValue` IS the USB HID keyboard usage ID (0x04 = 'a', 0xE1 =
// left shift, ...). Mapping from the raw usage rather than from GCKeyCode's
// named constants is deliberate: the usage table is fixed by the USB HID spec
// and complete, whereas the named constants are an SDK-version-dependent subset
// (F13-F24 and most of the international keys have no constant at all). One
// switch over integers covers every key a keyboard can send, including the ones
// Apple never named.
//
// WHAT THE DRIVER ALREADY DOES, SO THIS FILE DOES NOT.
//
// Extended keys need no special handling here: driver_ios.c:141 derives the
// scan code with MAPVK_VK_TO_VSC_EX and sets KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY whenever
// that returns 0xE0xx — arrows, the nav cluster, right ctrl/alt, numpad divide,
// NumLock. The generic VK_SHIFT/VK_CONTROL/VK_MENU a game reads with
// GetAsyncKeyState are synthesised by the wineserver from the left/right ones
// (queue_ios.c:1704-1717). So posting VK_LSHIFT is both more precise than
// posting VK_SHIFT and strictly more compatible.

    // ========================================================================
    // ml665 — THE ASSISTIVETOUCH MOUSE, AND WHY IT FELT BAD.
    //
    // THE REQUIREMENT WE CANNOT REMOVE. On iPhone there is no public HID path
    // to a Bluetooth mouse at all: pointer devices are routed ONLY through
    // AssistiveTouch (Settings ▸ Accessibility ▸ Touch ▸ AssistiveTouch ▸ On,
    // then Devices). With it off, GCMouse enumerates the device and delivers
    // nothing; with it on, `mouseMovedHandler` fires. `prefersPointerLocked` is
    // an iPad API — iPhone has no system pointer to lock, so the request is
    // inert there (see `setPointerLocked`). None of that is something this app
    // can work around, so it is stated here and in the UI rather than retried.
    //
    // WHAT MADE IT STUTTER. AssistiveTouch turns a mouse CLICK into a
    // synthesised TOUCH at the accessibility cursor's position, delivered as an
    // ordinary `.direct` UITouch — not `.indirectPointer`. So a click used to
    // land in `MetalBackedView.touchesBegan` as a finger: absolute
    // MOVE|LEFTDOWN|ABSOLUTE at the cursor's screen point, which SNAPS the
    // game's cursor there, after which our relative deltas resume from the new
    // place. Click, jump, drift back, click, jump: exactly the "stuttery,
    // didn't feel good" the user reported. Worse, the same synthesised touch
    // can land on an on-screen control and press it.
    //
    // The buttons are already carried correctly by GCMouse's own
    // `pressedChangedHandler`, so the synthesised touch is pure duplication.
    // While a real mouse is live (`mousePath == .gcmouse` and a delta inside
    // `Self.mouseActiveWindow`), `shouldIgnore(_:)` classifies each incoming
    // `.direct` touch and both the live view and `ControlOverlayView` drop the
    // synthesised ones. `InputSettings.ignoreTouchesWithMouse` is the knob that
    // turns the whole thing off if the heuristic ever misfires on a device we
    // have not seen.
    //
    // DELIVERY. `handlerQueue` used to be `.main` — the same queue SwiftUI
    // re-renders and the log console scrolls on, so a mouse sample could sit
    // behind a body evaluation. It is `mouseQueue` now, a dedicated serial
    // `.userInteractive` queue, which makes `moved`/`button`/`scrolled`
    // off-main: hence `motionLock` over the carries and counters, and a main
    // hop for everything that touches `@Published` state, `InputGuard` or the
    // `Timer`. `winios_pointer` is posted DIRECTLY from the mouse queue — the
    // ring behind it takes its own mutex and has always been written from
    // whatever thread had the event.

    // ========================================================================
    // ml664 — A GCMouse THAT CONNECTS AND NEVER REPORTS.
    //
    // Last run's evidence, in order: the keyboard worked; `GCMouse` produced a
    // DISCONNECT notification; `mouseConnected` was true and pointer lock
    // toggled on and off (which `setPointerLocked` refuses unless a mouse is
    // attached, so `mouseInput` was NOT nil); and across the whole session the
    // 1 Hz line read `mouse_dx=0 mouse_dy=0` with not one `drv_post_mouse`. So
    // GameController enumerated the device, handed over a `GCMouseInput`, and
    // then delivered zero callbacks through it.
    //
    // That is the documented iPhone shape of GCMouse, not a wiring mistake.
    // Pointer support on iOS is an iPad feature: iPadOS routes a Bluetooth
    // mouse to a system pointer and, for apps that ask, to GCMouse's raw HID
    // stream. iPhone has no system pointer — a mouse pairs there through
    // AssistiveTouch's pointer-device support, which OWNS the HID reports and
    // turns them into an accessibility cursor. `GCMouse` still vends the device
    // (it is a HID device, it enumerates, it disconnects) but the report stream
    // never reaches `mouseMovedHandler`. And `prefersPointerLocked` cannot
    // rescue it: there is no pointer to lock, so the request is inert.
    //
    // Hence defence in depth. This method wires GCMouse as well as it can be
    // wired — every device from both `mice()` and `current`, handlers re-armed
    // when one becomes current, nothing assumed about which object is live —
    // and `uikitMoved`/`uikitButtons`/`uikitScroll` below accept the same
    // motion from UIKit's indirect-pointer pipeline, which is the ONLY pipeline
    // an AssistiveTouch-owned or otherwise non-GC mouse can reach. Whichever
    // one produces a delta first wins, and says so in one line.
    //
    // HANDLER SIGNATURES, since a wrong one compiles and then never fires:
    //   mouseInput.mouseMovedHandler  : (GCMouseInput, Float, Float) -> Void
    //   button.pressedChangedHandler  : (GCControllerButtonInput, Float, Bool) -> Void
    //   scroll.valueChangedHandler    : (GCControllerDirectionPad, Float, Float) -> Void
    // `pressedChangedHandler` and `valueChangedHandler` on a button share one

    // and silently changes the semantics. Both are spelled out at each use.

    // MARK: - ml668 — THE GAMEPAD
    //
    // A controller paired to the phone has to reach the game by TWO roads at
    // once, and they are not alternatives:
    //
    //   1. XInput. Everything written after about 2006 asks XInput for a pad,
    //      and for those titles the right answer is to BE the pad. The sampler
    //      below writes an XINPUT_GAMEPAD-shaped struct into a shared slot
    //      (Winios.m, `winios_gamepad_set_state`), win32u reads it through one
    //      syscall, and wine's xinput1_3 hands it to the game. Nothing about
    //      the user's on-screen layout is involved: the game gets the raw pad.
    //
    //   2. The on-screen layout. Most of what this port actually runs is older
    //      than XInput and reads the keyboard and the mouse. For those, a
    //      controller is useless unless something turns its buttons into the
    //      keys they DO read — which is exactly what the landscape control
    //      layout already does for a thumb. So each control can name a physical
    //      button (`TouchControl.padBinding`), and pressing that button presses
    //      that control through the SAME `InputGuard` ownership path a finger
    //      uses: `ControlOverlayView.padPress` takes an owner, holds the
    //      control's own `ControlRegionKind`, and lights its face.
    //
    // BOTH AT ONCE IS CORRECT, not a conflict. It is what a PC with a
    // controller and a key remapper does, and a game can only notice if it
    // reads XInput *and* the keyboard for the same action — in which case the
    // user unbinds the control, which is what the panel is for.
    //
    // WHY 250 Hz AND WHY NOT A DISPLAY LINK. XInput's contract is a STATE that
    // is current when you ask; a game may poll it at 1 kHz, and a pad sampled
    // at the display's 60 Hz would hand that game the same sample sixteen times
    // and then jump. `CADisplayLink` cannot exceed the refresh rate, so it is
    // the wrong clock here however convenient it is elsewhere: a
    // `DispatchSourceTimer` at 4 ms on a dedicated `.userInteractive` queue is.
    // `valueChangedHandler` fires on the same queue and samples immediately, so
    // a button transition is never waiting out the rest of a tick.
    //
    // WHY NOT THE MAIN QUEUE. The same reason ml665 moved the mouse off it: a
    // sample queued behind a SwiftUI body evaluation is jitter the user feels.
    // Everything on the pad queue either writes the shared slot (thread-safe by
    // construction, see Winios.h) or hops to main — and the hop happens only
    // when something CHANGED, which for buttons is rare and for sticks is
    // throttled to 120 Hz, because `AimStickDriver` consumes its vector on a
    // display link and cannot use anything faster.

// ml663 — POINTER LOCK.
//
// Two separate problems, and only one of them is about the pointer being
// visible:
//
//   1. VISIBILITY. An unlocked iOS pointer draws a circle over the game
//      surface and highlights every SwiftUI control it passes. A UIPointerStyle
//      of .hidden() over the live view handles that part (see PointerHider).
//   2. CONTAINMENT. An unlocked pointer stops at the screen edge, and at the
//      edge it starts hitting the app's own chrome instead of the game. GCMouse
//      deltas keep arriving either way — they are raw HID — but the user is now
//      dragging a system cursor across a toolbar while trying to turn left.
//
// `prefersPointerLocked` fixes (2), and requires UIApplicationSupportsIndirect
// InputEvents=YES in Info.plist (added in the same revision).
//
// The awkward part is that UIKit asks the KEY WINDOW's root view controller for
// that preference, and this app's root is SwiftUI's own UIHostingController —
// an instance we never construct and cannot subclass. So the override is
// installed on its CLASS at runtime.
//
// That is narrower than it sounds. Swift generic classes get one ObjC class per
// specialisation, so `UIHostingController<ContentView>` is a class with exactly
// one instance in this process: the root. The pads' hosting controllers are
// UIHostingController<JoystickPadOverlay> and <TouchControlsOverlay> — different
// classes, untouched. And the override is added, not swizzled: nothing's
// existing implementation is displaced unless that concrete class already had
// one, which UIHostingController does not.
//
// Every step is guarded and reported. If any of it fails the app keeps working
// exactly as before, minus containment — which is why (1) is solved separately
// rather than as a consequence of this.
