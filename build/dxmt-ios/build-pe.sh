# Build DXMT's PE side (the DLLs Wine loads inside Madeira) with llvm-mingw.
#
# This is the counterpart to build.sh, which builds the unix/Metal half that
# links into Madeira.app.  Until milestone 4 the PE DLLs in
# app/Madeira/{aarch64,arm64ec}-windows/ were imported prebuilt, so there was
# no PE stage in this checkout at all; the D3D9 path needs an i386 build, so
# the stage now exists and is reproducible.
#
#   ./build-pe.sh                 # i386 only (the milestone-4 target)
#   ./build-pe.sh i386 aarch64    # more arches
#   ./build-pe.sh --targets winemetal.dll d3d9.dll
#   ./build-pe.sh --install all   # also install nvapi/nvngx and friends
#
# --targets limits what is BUILT; --install limits what is copied into
# app/Madeira/<arch>-windows/.  The install set defaults to the modules the
# Direct3D paths need, so that building the whole tree for a compile check
# does not quietly add DLLs to the app bundle that nothing has wired up yet.
#
# d3d11.dll / dxgi.dll / d3d10core.dll joined that default set on 2026-09-19
# (WOW64_DESIGN.md section 6): the 32-bit unix-call dispatch they need is the
# same winemetal wow64 table the D3D9 path already uses, and they REPLACE
# Wine's wined3d-based i386 copies -- .xtool/build-wine-i386.sh no longer
# builds those (NEVER_OVERWRITE/EXCLUDE/SKIP_BREADTH_REASON there), so a farm
# round will not overwrite what this stage installs.
#
# Why it builds out of a synced copy rather than in place: the native build
# workspace ($MADEIRA_WORK, recorded in .xtool/work-path) is a `git archive
# HEAD` export, so uncommitted submodule changes are invisible to it.  We
# rsync the tracked research/dxmt tree over the exported one first, the same
# way .xtool/build-fex.sh does for FEX.  Meson build dirs are excluded so a
# sync does not clobber a configured tree.

# MADEIRA (WOW64_DESIGN.md section 8.5): the i386 shim (built as d3d9shim.dll,
# since two meson targets cannot both be called d3d9) is now bound to its unix
# side -- virtual_ios.c's load_builtin_unixlib() has a `d3d9shim` branch that
# hands it dxmt_d3d9_unix_call_{,wow64_}funcs -- so it SHIPS as d3d9.dll and
# the emulated DXMT frontend ships beside it as d3d9-emulated.dll.
#
# Installing the shim as d3d9.dll is NOT the same thing as turning the native
# frontend on. With no knob set, the shim's DllMain forwards all ten exports
# to d3d9-emulated.dll (d3d9shim_main.c read_mode/forwarding), so the default
# path is byte for byte the frontend section 6 measured and log 41 ran at
# 30-40 fps -- the shim adds one LoadLibrary and a GetProcAddress per export,
# once. The native ARM64 frontend is opt-in, per session, with
# Documents/madeira-d3d9.txt = `native` (ContentView exports it as
# MADEIRA_D3D9), which is what makes the A/B of section 8.8-4 a one-file
# change on device rather than a reinstall.
#
# Set MADEIRA_D3D9_DEFAULT=emulated to go back to the previous mapping (the
# emulated build installed as BOTH d3d9.dll and d3d9-emulated.dll, the shim
# only as d3d9shim.dll, where nothing loads it) for a bisect. --install
# matches the INSTALLED name, so `--install d3d9.dll` always ships whichever
