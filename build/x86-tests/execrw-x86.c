/* MADEIRA-TEMP: the DEP-policy self-test — execrw-x86.exe / execrw-nx-x86.exe.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHY
 * -----------------------
 * On Windows a 32-bit image WITHOUT IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_NX_COMPAT runs with DEP
 * disabled: executing from ANY committed readable page is legal.  Essentially every
 * pre-Vista 32-bit program is built that way, and a large fraction of them depend on it —
 * copy-protection wrappers, self-decrypting unpackers and runtime thunk generators all
 * write machine code into ordinary PAGE_READWRITE memory and jump into it.
 *
 * On this port nothing host-executes a guest page: guest code is decoded by the emulator
 * and run out of the JIT pool, so "is this page executable" is a question answered by the
 * emulator's own bookkeeping rather than by the MMU.  That bookkeeping has to be told about
 * DEP, and it has to be told again every time such a page appears.  When it is not, the
 * frontend decodes the target as non-executable, raises its no-exec trap, and the thread
 * dies on what looks like a null dereference.  This file is the regression test for that
 * whole chain — the loader's NX_COMPAT check, its NtSetInformationProcess(ProcessExecuteFlags),
 * the wow64 notification, the emulator's promotion of the page, the write-trap that keeps
 * self-modifying code correct, and the runtime opt-in through SetProcessDEPPolicy.
 *
 * ONE SOURCE, TWO IMAGES.  The expectations are the exact opposite in the two DEP modes, and
 * the mode is a property of the IMAGE, so the program reads its OWN PE header rather than
 * being told by a #define — an exe that was linked with the wrong flag then fails loudly
 * instead of silently testing the other half.
 *
 *   execrw-x86.exe      linked --disable-nxcompat : DEP off.  Executing written-to
 *                       PAGE_READWRITE memory must WORK, including after rewriting it.
 *   execrw-nx-x86.exe   linked --nxcompat         : DEP on.   The same call must raise
 *                       STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION, and specifically an EXECUTE fault
 *                       (ExceptionInformation[0] == 8) at the address jumped to.
 *
 * THE PHASES (DEP-off image runs all of them; DEP-on image runs 1 and stops)
 *
 *   1. VirtualAlloc PAGE_READWRITE, write `mov eax,42 ; ret`, call through a function
 *      pointer.  The base case, and the one the device died on.
 *   2. SELF-MODIFYING: rewrite the immediate to 43 and call again WITHOUT any
 *      FlushInstructionCache, then 64 more rewrite-and-call rounds.  A cached translation
 *      of the old bytes returns the old value, so this fails loudly if the write-trap that
 *      invalidates translated code is not armed on a DEP-promoted page.  The deliberate
 *      absence of a cache flush is the point: an unpacker does not issue one either.
 *   3. HEAP: the same stub in HeapAlloc'd memory.  DEP-off applies to every committed
 *      readable page, not only to VirtualAlloc'd ones, and the heap reaches the emulator
 *      through a different notification than a fresh reservation does.
 *   4. RESERVE-THEN-COMMIT: MEM_RESERVE a region, MEM_COMMIT one page of it later, and
 *      execute from that.  Covers the commit-time path rather than the reserve-time one.
 *   5. RUNTIME OPT-IN: SetProcessDEPPolicy(PROCESS_DEP_ENABLE) turns DEP back ON for a
 *      process that started without it.  Every page promoted in phases 1-4 must stop being
 *      executable, so the first call afterwards must raise an execute access violation.
 *
 * HOW THE ACCESS VIOLATION IS CAUGHT.  There is no CRT and no __try here (clang's SEH is not
 * available for 32-bit x86), so recovery is a vectored exception handler that redirects Eip
 * to a tiny stub which just returns a sentinel.  The faulting instruction is the first byte
 * of the callee, so the stack is exactly as a called function expects it and the stub's
 * `ret` unwinds correctly.  The handler only claims faults inside the code buffer, and only
 * while a fault is expected, so a genuine bug elsewhere is still fatal and still reported.
 *
 * Deliberate restrictions, as in the other tests here: no CRT (this file supplies `start'
 * plus memset/memcpy and links -nostdlib, so its only import is kernel32), no 64-bit
 * division, no int-to-double conversion.
 *
 * Exit status (the runtime reports it as "MADEIRA-EXIT: ... status=<n>"):
 *
 *   52  PASS — every phase for this image's DEP mode behaved correctly
 *   40  VirtualAlloc(PAGE_READWRITE) failed
 *   41  DEP off: the call returned the wrong value
 *   42  DEP off: the call raised an access violation (DEP-off promotion is not happening)
 *   43  DEP on:  the call SUCCEEDED (DEP is not being enforced)
 *   44  DEP on:  a fault, but not an execute fault at the address jumped to
 *   45  DEP off: the single self-modifying rewrite returned the OLD value (stale translation)
 *   46  DEP off: the self-modifying loop returned a wrong value
 *   47  DEP off: executing from heap memory failed
 *   48  DEP off: executing from separately-committed memory failed
 *   49  SetProcessDEPPolicy(PROCESS_DEP_ENABLE) failed
 *   50  GetProcessDEPPolicy did not report DEP enabled afterwards
 *   51  DEP enabled at runtime, yet the call still succeeded
 *   53  AddVectoredExceptionHandler failed
 *   54  could not read this image's own PE header

/* ------------------------------------------------ phase 6: patch a system DLL
 *
 * THE ONE CASE NO OTHER PHASE COVERS: an INLINE HOOK of a system DLL's .text,
 * on a page the emulator has ALREADY TRANSLATED.
 *
 * Every phase above writes code into memory the program owns.  A copy-protection
 * wrapper, an overlay, a file-redirection shim and a debugger-detection bypass all
 * do something different: they take a function that is already running, change its
 * protection to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, and overwrite its first bytes.  Three
 * separate things have to be true for that to work here, and NONE of them is
 * exercised anywhere else in this file:
 *
 *   (a) VirtualProtect( PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE ) on an image page has to SUCCEED,
 *       and it has to actually make the page writable — an image view is mapped
 *       read-only and its host mapping may not even permit execute, so "the call
 *       returned TRUE" and "the store will land" are different claims;
 *   (b) the store itself has to land, which is checked here by READING THE BYTES
 *       BACK rather than by trusting that the write was issued;
 *   (c) the emulator has to notice that a page it has already translated changed,
 *       and re-translate it.  The function is called a thousand times first
 *       precisely so that a translation exists to go stale.
 *
 * NO FlushInstructionCache BEFORE THE FIRST CALL, deliberately, for the same
 * reason as phase 2: real patchers frequently omit it, x86 does not require it,
 * and the whole point of a write-trap is to make it unnecessary.  It IS issued on
 * the restore, because by then the test is only tidying up.
 *
 * The target is chosen for being trivially verifiable and unused by anything else
 * while the test runs: a no-argument function returning a small integer.  Its
 * original bytes are restored before the phase returns, so nothing downstream can
 * observe the patch even if a later phase fails.
