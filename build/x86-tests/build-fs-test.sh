# MADEIRA-TEMP: build the ml914 path-cache stress self-test, fs-x86.exe.
# See build/x86-tests/fs-x86.c for what it asserts and what each exit code
# means, and wine/dlls/ntdll/unix/file.c (the ios_pc_* / ios_np_* / ios_cs_memo
# blocks) for the mechanism under test.
#
# Kept separate from build.sh (owned by the 32-bit bring-up track) and from the
# other per-test scripts here, the same way those are kept separate from each
# other: this stage only adds files.
#
# Usage: ./build-fs-test.sh
#
# Produces fs-x86.exe (i386 PE) and copies it into app/Madeira/i386-windows/
# so the IPA build picks it up.  The only import must be kernel32; the script
# asserts it, because anything else drags a loader path through the very
# lookup caches this test is trying to observe in isolation.
