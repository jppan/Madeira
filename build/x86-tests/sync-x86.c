/* MADEIRA-TEMP: the stress self-test for the ml952 in-process event fast path
 * ("fastsync", WOW64_DESIGN.md section 6 / build/ntdll-unix/shims/ios_fastsync.h).
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHY EACH CHECK IS HERE
 * ------------------------------------------
 * fastsync moves SetEvent / ResetEvent / WaitForSingleObject off the wineserver
 * and onto a shared cell word, which means the properties the server used to
 * guarantee structurally are now guaranteed by compare-and-swap ordering
 * instead.  Three of them can be broken without the game crashing -- it would
 * just deadlock, or run one frame ahead of itself -- so they are asserted here
 * rather than left to be noticed on a device:
 *
 *  1. PING-PONG (auto-reset, two threads).  100,000 round trips over a pair of
 *     auto-reset events, each side asserting that the shared counter has the
 *     exact value its turn implies.  A lost wakeup hangs; a doubled wakeup
 *     (two threads released by one SetEvent) shows up immediately as a
 *     counter that moved twice.  This is the exact shape of the traffic
 *     [srv-stats] measured on the 32-bit title: main thread <-> render thread,
 *     an auto-reset event in each direction.
 *
 *  2. EXACTLY-ONCE (auto-reset, many waiters).  Four threads wait on ONE
 *     auto-reset event; the main thread sets it N times with a full handshake
 *     between sets.  Exactly N wakeups must be observed in total -- never
 *     N+1, which is what a client CAS racing the server's claim would produce.
 *
 *  3. RELEASE-ALL (manual-reset).  Four threads wait on one manual-reset
 *     event; one SetEvent must release all four, and a following ResetEvent
 *     must make the next wait block again.  A manual event that is consumed
 *     like an auto-reset one passes test 1 and fails only here.
 *
 *  4. TIMEOUT, three ways.  A wait with a finite timeout on an event nobody
 *     sets must return WAIT_TIMEOUT, and must not return early -- the fast
 *     path adjusts a relative timeout by the time it already spent, and an
 *     arithmetic slip there turns every timed wait into a spin.  (a) 300 ms,
 *     longer than the fast-path cap, so the server gets a remainder: it must
 *     be neither short nor absurdly long.  (b) 1 ms, SHORTER than the cap, the
 *     one case where handing the server a zero remainder is right.  (c) twenty
 *     10 ms waits in a row must add up to at least 100 ms of real time -- a
 *     timed wait that returns instantly passes (a) and (b) only by luck but
 *     can never pass this, and "returns instantly" is exactly what turns a
 *     loader's retry delay into a busy loop that starves what it waits for.
 *
 * Deliberate restrictions, the same ones the other tests in this directory
 * work under: no CRT (this file supplies `start' plus memset/memcpy and links
 * -nostdlib, so its only import is kernel32), no 64-bit division, no
 * int-to-double conversion.
 *
 *  5. THREAD-START HANDSHAKE with handle reuse (ml962).  This is the shape the
 *     device actually died on: a worker publishes a pointer and then signals a
 *     private auto-reset event, and its creator wakes and dereferences that
 *     pointer.  If the wait returns for any reason other than that SetEvent --
 *     because the handle resolved to ANOTHER event's cell, or because one set
 *     released two waiters -- the pointer is still NULL and a real program
 *     faults at NULL+small.  The event is created and closed FRESH on every one
 *     of 20,000 iterations so that handle values, cells and the client cache
 *     slot for that handle are all recycled under the test, which is what the
 *     seqlock-publish race needs.
 *
 *  6. SERVER-QUEUED waiter vs FAST-PATH waiter (ml962).  The fast path only
 *     parks for its cap (2 ms) and then hands the wait to the wineserver, so a
 *     slow handoff puts a waiter in the SERVER's queue while a second waiter is
 *     still on the cell.  One SetEvent must still release exactly one of them.
 *     ml952 released both: the client updated the cell AND sent `event_op
 *     SET_EVENT', and if the fast waiter took the token first the server's own
 *     set re-signalled the cell and woke a queued thread as well.  Round trips
 *     here are deliberately >5 ms so the server queue is the normal case.
 *
 *  7. MANUAL-RESET "loader done" under cell churn.  Four waiters park on one
 *     manual event while another thread creates and closes several hundred
 *     unrelated events, recycling cells and handle values underneath them.
 *     One SetEvent must release all four and no waiter may be released early.
 *
 *  8. TIMEOUT WITH A LATE SET.  A timed wait that IS satisfied, late enough to
 *     have passed through the fast path's cap and into the server, must report
 *     WAIT_OBJECT_0 -- and a timed wait whose set comes after the deadline must
 *     still report WAIT_TIMEOUT.  Both halves check the elapsed time.
 *
 *  9. EVENT INSIDE A FREED AND REALLOCATED STRUCT.  Same handshake as 5, but
 *     the handle and the payload live in a heap node that is freed and
 *     re-allocated every round, so the node address is recycled as well.
 *
 * 10. JOB SYSTEM (ml982).  Tests 1-9 each isolate one property with one wait
 *     shape.  This one reproduces the shape the device measurement actually
 *     showed -- a title whose worker pool is fed by one producer over a single
 *     auto-reset event, with every wait shape in the mix at once:
 *
 *       - 6 workers rotating, per iteration, through WaitForSingleObject
 *         INFINITE / 1 ms / 0 ms poll / WaitForMultipleObjects over TWO
 *         handles with a 50 ms timeout.  The same event is therefore waited on
 *         through the client fast path AND queued in the wineserver's own
 *         select at the same time, by different threads, continuously -- which
 *         is the one interleaving that needs the client and the server views
 *         of the signaled state to stay coherent (`waitN' was 474 per 10 s in
 *         the measurement, i.e. rare but always present).
 *       - a producer publishing bursts of 1-8 jobs, some of them SET through a
 *         handle freshly created by DuplicateHandle and closed straight after,
 *         so handle values and client cache slots for a LIVE event churn too.
 *       - a churn thread creating and closing unrelated events throughout, so
 *         server cells are recycled under everybody.
 *
 *     EXACT ACCOUNTING, which is what makes this a test rather than a soak:
 *     every job is produced once and, because a job is claimed with an atomic
 *     decrement of the outstanding count, can be consumed exactly once.  After
 *     each burst the producer waits for consumed == produced with a ONE SECOND
 *     deadline, and at the end the outstanding count must be zero: a lost
 *     wakeup that a soak test would hide as a stall is a failure here, and it
 *     names the counters.
 *
 *     It also asserts the two poll answers every round, because the read-only
 *     zero-timeout answer (MADEIRA_FS_POLLPEEK) is the half of this mechanism
 *     that is ON by default: a manual-reset event must read signaled TWICE
 *     after one SetEvent and not-signaled after ResetEvent, and an auto-reset
 *     event must be consumed by a poll EXACTLY once.
 *
 * 11. SEMAPHORE JOB SYSTEM (ml1010).  The same shape again, on the object the
 *     measurement that motivated ml1010 actually uses: a producer that hands n
 *     tokens to a worker pool in ONE ReleaseSemaphore.  Its accounting is
 *     STRICTER than test 10's, because a semaphore release of n releases
 *     exactly n waiters -- so a wakeup with no job behind it is a failure here
 *     rather than a legal leftover, which is what catches a token handed out
 *     twice or minted out of nothing.  It also asserts the arithmetic the
 *     client fast path now performs for itself: the previous-count return
 *     value, the max-count refusal changing nothing, a count-of-zero release
 *     (the request the client sends to make the server re-run its own queue),
 *     and that a timed-out wait never consumed a token it then dropped.
 *
 * Deliberate restrictions, the same ones the other tests in this directory
 * work under: no CRT (this file supplies `start' plus memset/memcpy and links
 * -nostdlib, so its only import is kernel32), no 64-bit division, no
 * int-to-double conversion.
 *
 * Exit status (the runtime reports it as "MADEIRA-EXIT: ... status=<n>"):
 *   46  every check passed
 *   50  CreateEvent/CreateThread failed
 *   51  ping-pong: a counter had the wrong value for whose turn it was
 *   52  ping-pong: a wait did not complete within the watchdog
 *   53  exactly-once: the wakeup total was not N
 *   54  manual-reset: SetEvent did not release every waiter
 *   55  manual-reset: the event stayed signaled after ResetEvent
 *   56  a finite-timeout wait did not return WAIT_TIMEOUT, or returned early
 *   57  handshake: the wait returned before the producer published its pointer
 *   58  server-queue vs fast path: one SetEvent released more than one waiter
 *   59  manual-reset under churn: released early, or not all waiters released
 *   60  late set: a satisfied timed wait reported the wrong result or time
 *   61  heap-node handshake: the wait returned before the producer published
 *   62  job system: a produced job was not consumed within one second
 *   63  job system: a multi-object wait was released by the wrong handle
 *   64  job system: a zero-timeout poll gave the wrong answer for the event
 *   65  semaphore job system: a wait was released without a job behind it, a
 *       job was not consumed within one second, a release failed, or the
 *       previous count it reported was impossible
 *   66  semaphore: the previous-count return, the max-count refusal, a
 *       count-of-zero release or a zero-timeout poll gave the wrong answer

/* ------------------------------------- 11: SEMAPHORE job system (ml1010) */

/* WHY A SEPARATE TEST AND NOT A VARIANT OF TEST 10.
 *
 * A semaphore carries a COUNT, and that makes its accounting STRICTER than an
 * auto-reset event's, not looser.  One ReleaseSemaphore( h, n ) releases
 * exactly n waiters, so unlike test 10 -- where a release that finds the
 * counter empty is legal and merely counted -- here a wait that returns
 * WAIT_OBJECT_0 without a job behind it is a DEFECT and fails the run.  That
 * is the property a client-side CAS can break in the two directions this
 * round has to prove it does not: a token handed out twice (two waiters
 * released by one release) and a token lost (a waiter that never wakes, or a
 * timed-out waiter that consumed one and dropped it).
 *
 *   - 6 workers rotating, per iteration, through WaitForSingleObject INFINITE
 *     / 1 ms / a 0 ms poll / WaitForMultipleObjects over TWO handles with a
 *     50 ms timeout, so the same semaphore is waited on through the client
 *     fast path AND queued in the wineserver's own select at the same time by
 *     different threads, continuously.  The second handle is a semaphore that
 *     is never released: a wakeup on it means a handle resolved to the wrong
 *     object.
 *   - a producer publishing bursts of 1..8 in ONE ReleaseSemaphore -- the
 *     operation an event cannot express at all -- and checking the previous
 *     count it reports, some of them through a handle freshly created by
 *     DuplicateHandle and closed straight after.
 *   - a churn thread creating and closing unrelated semaphores and events, so
 *     server cells and client cache slots are recycled under everybody.
 *
 * Plus the three arithmetic facts the fast path now computes for itself:
 * the previous-count return value, the max-count refusal (which must change
 * nothing), and a count of zero (which is the request the client sends to make
 * the server re-run its own wait queue, so it has to be a clean no-op). */
